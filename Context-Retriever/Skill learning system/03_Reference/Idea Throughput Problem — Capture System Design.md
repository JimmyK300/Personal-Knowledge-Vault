## Problem

Idea speed > expression speed.  
Friction in capture + formatting reduces output.

---

## Principle

Optimize for idea extraction rate, not grammar quality.

Extract first. Structure automatically. Refine later.

---

## Current Workflow

Raw dump → AI formats to Markdown → Paste into `/Inbox`.

---

## Upgrade Path

Level 1: Manual paste (now).  
Level 2: Email auto-import.  
Level 3: Voice → AI → Direct vault write.

Goal: Reduce friction without overbuilding.
