## One Rule

Only optimize something if:

(Time Saved × Frequency) is large enough to matter over 6–12 months.

If not, execute instead.

---

## Three Filters

Before optimizing, ask:

1. Is this repeated at least weekly?
2. Will this still exist in 6 months?
3. Does this directly increase real output?

If any answer is "no" → do not optimize.

---

## One Warning

Do not optimize to feel productive.
Optimize only to increase output.

If the system does not improve results within 14 days → remove it.
