# System Principles

This system exists to:
- Reduce mental reload cost
- Preserve decisions, not information
- Allow safe forgetting
- Make re-entry fast (< 2 minutes)

## Non-negotiables
- Every active context has a LAST STATE
- No information without purpose
- Deletion is success, not failure
- Structure serves thinking, not aesthetics

## Red Lines (Never Do)
- Turn this into a dumping ground
- Optimize structure instead of output
- Keep notes “just in case”
- Use AI to decide what matters

## Success Signals
- I reopen contexts easily
- I stop rethinking old decisions
- I check this system because it helps

## Failure Signals
- I avoid opening the vault
- I collect but don’t compress
- I don’t know what to do next
