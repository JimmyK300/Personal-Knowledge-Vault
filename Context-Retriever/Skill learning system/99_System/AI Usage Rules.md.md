# AI Usage Rules

## AI is allowed to:
- Summarize my own notes
- Spot inconsistencies
- Ask clarifying questions
- Help with reflection
- Generate re-entry summaries

## AI must be monitored when:
- Designing systems
- Writing architecture
- Planning long-term direction

## AI must never:
- Decide what matters
- Define my identity
- Replace judgment

AI is a copilot, not a compass.
