**One-line summary:** We’ll create **3 real Contexts right now** by extracting what already occupies your mental bandwidth, then locking each into a _re-entry–safe_ state.

We’ll do this **together**, step by step.  
I’ll guide; you answer briefly. No perfection.

## Step 0 — Ground rule (important)

A **Context is not**:

- a project plan
    
- a task list
    
- a knowledge base
    

A **Context is**:

> “Something my brain keeps reloading in the background.”

If it costs you attention when you’re _not_ working on it, it qualifies.

## Step 1 — Identify your 3 Contexts

Answer **only with short phrases** (no explanations yet).

### Question 1

**When you stop working and do nothing, what 3 things still pull at your mind?**

Examples (do NOT copy these unless true):

- “My startup direction”
    
- “System for managing my life”
    
- “Whether I’m using AI correctly”
    
- “Architecture quality of my codebase”
    
- “Long-term learning direction”
    

👉 **Reply with exactly 3 bullet points.**

## Step 2 — We’ll immediately lock each one

Once you reply, I will:

- Turn each into a proper `Context:` title
    
- Help you write:
    
    - **What this is**
        
    - **Why this matters**
        
    - **LAST STATE** (this is the key)
        
    - **Next sensible action**
        

I will **not** over-structure or over-plan.

---

## What this gives you (so you trust the process)

After this:

- You’ll have **3 files** you can reopen anytime
    
- Your brain no longer needs to “remember everything”
    
- You’ll feel a small but noticeable mental release
    

This is the foundation for everything else (skills, systems, AI delegation).

Go ahead.  
**Three bullet points.**
