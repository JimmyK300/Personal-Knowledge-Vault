this has to do with the development of personal skill. this specific skill is related to personal speaking and stuff. like how to be interesting in a way that is fun and spread so gets closer to other
like what i noticed this time is that you have to be very active, very talkative when you are the main initiator or wants to be the main initiator.
then you have to find a way to not steal the spotlight, but control the spotlight so that others also have time to shine
i also noticed that i am quite weak in defending. what do i mean by this. when other people talk, my respond isn't quite as good, especially true when it is a defending, like other are attacking or criticizing what i am doing. i usually only generate the answer hours later when i am replaying the conversation or my brain lags.
