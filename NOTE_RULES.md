## When Learning

* Write 1 goal sentence before starting
* Capture fragments only (no formatting)
* Mark `??` confusion immediately
* 45 min hard stop
* No rereading / cleaning mid-session

---

## When Reorganizing

* Delete 30%
* Extract 5 principles
* Write 3 If→Then rules
* Write 3 failure modes
* One page max → close for 48h

---

## To Force Opening Notes First

* Open last note before new session
* Read principles + rules only (3 min timer)
* Add 1 line: “Today I build on ___”
* Only then allowed to start
* If skipped → session invalid

No debate. Only execution.
