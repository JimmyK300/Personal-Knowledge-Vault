# 🧠 Personal Operating Model

## Identity

**Type:** Depth integrator  
**Constraint:** Energy-limited, not ability-limited  
**Latency:** Insight emerges after consolidation (24–48h)

Old belief → Slow  
Correct belief → High-depth processor with recovery requirement

---

## Energy Rules

- 3–4h max deep cognitive load/day
    
- No meetings after heavy depth
    
- Add decompression before social tasks
    
- Separate days:
    
    - Depth
        
    - Execution
        
    - Social
        

Overload pattern to avoid:  
Deep ML + chess + YouTube + meeting → cognitive collapse

Recovery = integration phase.

---

## Learning Loop

Not:  
Learn → Finish → Create

Actual:  
Learn → Apply → Modify → Fail → Integrate → Repeat

Learning and building are the same loop.

Weekly rule:

- 1 meaningful concept
    
- 1 produced artifact
    

No passive accumulation.

---

## Compounding Principle

Progress curve:  
Flat → Sudden acceleration

Consistency > speed  
Fragmentation kills compounding.

---

## AI Usage Rule

Use AI for:

- Syntax
    
- Boilerplate
    
- Speed
    

Do NOT outsource:

- Structural reasoning
    
- Assumption selection
    
- Framework construction
    

Struggle builds compression.

# 🔬 Research Thesis — Iterative Latent Refinement

## Core Claim

Reasoning = iterative improvement of an internal state before output.

Formal skeleton:

After T refinement steps → produce output.

Transformers ≈ single-pass depth.  
Hypothesis: controlled recurrence improves reasoning efficiency.

---

## Clean Experimental Question

At equal:

- Parameters
    
- FLOPs
    
- Data
    

Does iterative recurrence outperform static transformer depth on reasoning tasks?

If no → discard idea.  
If yes → publishable signal.

---

## Minimal 3-Step Plan

### 1. Baseline

Small transformer  
Tasks: arithmetic, multi-step reasoning  
Measure: accuracy, FLOPs, params

---

### 2. Recurrent Variant

Replace 12 layers with 3 layers looped 4×  
Same params  
Compare reasoning accuracy

---

### 3. Adaptive Compute

Model chooses number of refinement steps

Test:  
Does adaptive depth increase compute efficiency?

---

## What Is Explicitly Ignored

- Brain metaphors
    
- AGI speculation
    
- Philosophy of compression
    
- Mystical energy narratives
    

Only controlled architectural comparison matters.

---

## Strategic Position

Not scaling war.  
Testing inductive bias:

Is iterative refinement a better reasoning prior than static depth?

---

# 🎯 6-Month Focus

1. Master transformer internals.
    
2. Implement recurrent loop variant.
    
3. Run controlled experiments.
    
4. Write clean analysis.
    

No additional theory until experiment exists.

---

# Ultra-Compressed Thesis (1 Paragraph)

Build a same-scale model that replaces static transformer depth with iterative latent refinement loops, evaluate reasoning under equal compute, and determine whether structured recurrence provides measurable advantage.
