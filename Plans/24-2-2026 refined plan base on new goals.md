# Focus Direction (Compressed)

## Core Thesis

Build **math depth + strong engineering + research literacy** around intelligent systems.

---

## Primary Field

**Applied Math + Computer Science → Intelligent Systems**

---

## 1. Mathematical Foundation (Non-Negotiable)

* Linear algebra
* Calculus
* Probability & statistics
* Optimization

Goal: understand models, not just use them.

---

## 2. Engineering Competence (Employability Shield)

* Backend systems
* Databases
* System design basics
* Clean code / version control
* Ship real projects consistently

Goal: be reliably hireable.

---

## 3. Research Literacy (Long-Term Edge)

* Read papers
* Reproduce small implementations
* Structured note-taking
* Think in models, not vibes

Goal: move from user → builder → thinker.

---

## Weekly Allocation

* 40% math depth
* 40% engineering building
* 20% exploratory research

---

## Strategic Reminder

Risk ≠ lack of ability.
Risk = scattered effort.

Depth compounds.
Consistency beats intensity.
