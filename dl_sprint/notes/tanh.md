suppose P = tanh(z) = (ez - e-z) / (ez + e-z)
so dP/dz = ((ez - e-z)'(ez + e-z) - (ez - e-z)(ez + e-z)') / (ez + e-z)^2
         = 2((ez + e-z) - (ez - e-z)) / (ez + e-z)^2
         = 2e-z/(ez + e-z)^2
so some thing that has derivative that can cancel out the denominator will have quite a nice thing (nicer if can cancel out both)

actrually:
d/d​z tanh(z)=1−tanh2(z)
tanh(z)=2σ(2z)−1
