A.
w=(3,4)
x=(−8,6)
w.x = 3*-8 + 4*6 = 0
||x||2 = sqrt(64+36) = 10 this is L2 norm
and
||w||2 = sqrt(16+9) = 5
cos(θ) = 90 degs (right)

B.
neuron: z = w.x + b
decision boundary equation: 
w.x + b = 0
2x1 - x2 - 4 = 0 
slope intercept form: x2 = 2x1 - 4
slope is 2
yes this boundary is perpendicular to w because we set z to zero. a dot product between x and w equals to 0 when x is perpendicular to w

C.
z=100x1 ​+ 0.01x2​ − 5
change x1 by 0.01 then z changes by 1
change x2 by 10 then z changes by 0.1
this means that numberically x1 is much more sensitive than x2. the line is going to be slanted in the x1 direction much more, and for sigmoid gradient field, it will looks much more steep in the x1 direction

D.
the decision boundary doesn't move
sigmoid output becomes much sharper
gradient mangitude increase

E.
shape of W is 7x4
shape of b idk, maybe R^4
shape of output is gonna be 4x1
